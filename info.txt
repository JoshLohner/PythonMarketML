Questions I want to ask:
1. Regression Tasks
Predict the average price of avocados based on features like total volume, type, and region.
Model: Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) or Sequential Model.
Example Question: "What will be the average price of avocados in Albany next week?"

2. Time Series Forecasting
Predict future average prices or total volume using historical data.
Model: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or Transformer models.
Example Question: "What will be the average price of avocados in the next month based on historical trends?"

3. Clustering
Group regions based on similarities in average price, total volume, and other features.
Model: Autoencoders for dimensionality reduction followed by clustering algorithms.
Example Question: "Which regions have similar avocado sales patterns?"

4. Anomaly Detection
Detect unusual patterns in avocado sales or prices (e.g., sudden spikes or drops).
Model: Autoencoders or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).
Example Question: "Are there any anomalies in avocado sales data for a specific region?"

5. Recommendation Systems
Recommend regions or types of avocados to focus on for marketing based on sales data.
Model: Collaborative Filtering or Neural Networks.
Example Question: "Which type of avocado should be promoted in a specific region based on historical sales?"
